# NetworkPeek
This program uses the nmap3 library to list either the open ports on a device or all the active IP addresses on the network, depending on arguments.  It defaults to listing the open ports on the user's device.  To run, simply run it in Python with the command line.

NetworkPeek assumes a class C network scheme.

For the entertainment of the viewer, I have left in a number of not-quite-professional comments that I would normally delete if I typed them up at all.
